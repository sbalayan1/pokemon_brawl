  🙋‍♂️About
</h2>

<p>
After graduating from the University of San Francisco, I spent some time working as a Hedge Fund Associate at Asymmetry Capital Management. There I assisted the Healthcare Investment team with equity valuation, financial modeling, and research. After some time I came to the the conclusion that this career wasn't for me and left. Feeling lost, unstructured, and unfulfilled, albeit with endless potential, I eventually found myself applying to Flatiron School. And of course the rest is history. 

Now that I've graduated I spend most of my time coding and searching for new opportunities. Current interests include equity markets, crypto, AI, machine learning, game development, and anything tech related.
