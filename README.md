    PokemonBrawl
</h1>

<p>
  üéÆJust like old Pokemon Games, PokemonBrawl is a mock Pokemon Battle Application that allows users to catch Pokemon, build and customize teams, and battle other trainers!
</p>

<h2>
  LOOK HERE! Launch the application through your local environment. 
</h2>

<h4>PostgreSQL Installation for WSL</h4>
<p>PostgreSQL is utilized as my database. This needs to be downloaded to be used. To install Postgres for WSL, run the following commands from your Ubuntu terminal:</p>
    
    - sudo apt update
    - sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev
  
<p>Then confirm that Postgres was installed successfully:</p>

    - psql --version

<p>Run this command to start the Postgres service:</p>
  
    - sudo service postgresql start
  
<p>Finally, you'll also need to create a database user so that you are able to connect to the database from Rails. First, check what your operating system username is:</p>
  
    - whoami

<p>If your username is "ian", for example, you'd need to create a Postgres user with that same name. To do so, run this command to open the Postgres CLI:</p>
  
    - sudo -u postgres -i

<p>From the Postgres CLI, run this command (replacing "ian" with your username):</p>
  
    - createuser -sr ian

<p>Then enter control + d or type logout to exit.</p>

<h3>Start the application</h3>
<p>1. In your terminal, run the following commands first to setup, create and seed the database</p>

    - bundle install
    - rake db:migrate
    - rake db:seed

<p>2. In your terminal, run the following commands to start the server. A window to localhost:3000 should open in your browser. This serves as your view into the database. You will not need this unless you are developing. Keep this to the side.</p>
    
    - bin/rails server

<p>3. In a NEW terminal, run the following commands to start the client and select YES. A window to localhost:3001 should open in your browser. This serves as the user interface for the game. Feel free to make an account, catch pokemon, and battle!</p>

    - npm start --prefix client
    
<p>4. CONGRATS! You can now access PokemonBrawl!!</p>

  üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èAbout
</h2>

<p>
After graduating from the University of San Francisco, I spent some time working as a Hedge Fund Associate at Asymmetry Capital Management. There I assisted the Healthcare Investment team with equity valuation, financial modeling, and research. After some time I came to the the conclusion that this career wasn't for me and left. Feeling lost, unstructured, and unfulfilled, albeit with endless potential, I eventually found myself applying to Flatiron School. And of course the rest is history. 

Now that I've graduated I spend most of my time coding and searching for new opportunities. Current interests include equity markets, crypto, AI, machine learning, game development, and anything tech related. 
</p>

<p>Front End -> JavaScript, React </p>
<p>Back End -> Ruby on Rails </p>
<p>Other Skills -> Redux, SQL, PostgreSQL, ActiveRecord, BCrypt, MaterialUI, Postman API, JSON, MVC Architecture, REST conventions, Rack, Hooks, State, Event Handling, Conditional Rendering</p>
