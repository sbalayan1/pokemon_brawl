## Steps I am taking to refactor, rebuild, and redeploy PokemonBrawl

1. Document goals and MVC.
2. Understand and document schema and get an understanding of the tables and their relationships
3. Update tables via migration, relationships, serializers, models, routes, and controllers. 
4. Write test documentation. Need to go through user journies to figure out user actions.
5. Using user journies/actions, develop backend tests to ensure CRUD actions on data behave correctly.
